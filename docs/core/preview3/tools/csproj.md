# Additions to the csproj format for .NET Core

[!INCLUDE[preview-warning](../../../includes/warning.md)]

This document outlines the changes that were added to the csproj files as part of the move from `project.json` to `csproj` and 
[MSBuild](https://github.com/Microsoft/MSBuild). For more information about general project file syntax and reference, 
see [the MSBuild project file](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-project-file-schema-reference) documentation.  

## Additions

* PackageReference
Item that specifies a NuGet dependency in the project. The `Include` attribute specifies the package ID. 

```xml
<PackageReference Include="<package-id>" Version="" PrivateAssets="" IncludeAssets="" ExcludeAssets="" />
```

*# Version
`Version` specifies the version of the package to restore. The element respects the rules of the NuGet versioning scheme.

*# IncludeAssets
`IncludeAssets` attribute specifies what assets belonging to the package specified by `<PackageReference>` should be 
consumed. 

The attribute can contain one or more of the following values:

* `Compile` – the contents of the lib folder are available to compile against.
* `Runtime` – the contents of the runtime folder are distributed.
* `ContentFiles` – the contents of the contentfiles folder are used.
* `Build` – the props/targets in the build folder are used.
* `Native` – the contents from native assets are copied to the output folder for runtime.
* `Analyzers` – the analyzers are used.

Alternatively, the attribute can contain:

* `None` – none of the assets are used.
* `All` – all assets are used.

*# ExcludeAssets
`ExcludeAssets` attribute specifies what assets belonging to the package specified by `<PackageReference>` should not 
be consumed.

The attribute can contain one or more of the following values:

* `Compile` – the contents of the lib folder are available to compile against.
* `Runtime` – the contents of the runtime folder are distributed.
* `ContentFiles` – the contents of the contentfiles folder are used.
* `Build` – the props/targets in the build folder are used.
* `Native` – the contents from native assets are copied to the output folder for runtime.
* `Analyzers` – the analyzers are used.

Alternatively, the element can contain:

* `None` – none of the assets are used.
* `All` – all assets are used.

*# PrivateAssets
`PrivateAssets` attribute specifies what assets belonging to the package specified by `<PackageReference>` should be 
consumed but that they should not flow to the next project. 

> [!NOTE]
> This is a new term for project.json/xproj `SuppressParent` element. 

The attribute can contain one or more of the following values:

* `Compile` – the contents of the lib folder are available to compile against.
* `Runtime` – the contents of the runtime folder are distributed.
* `ContentFiles` – the contents of the contentfiles folder are used.
* `Build` – the props/targets in the build folder are used.
* `Native` – the contents from native assets are copied to the output folder for runtime.
* `Analyzers` – the analyzers are used.

Alternatively, the attribute can contain:

* `None` – none of the assets are used.
* `All` – all assets are used.

* DotnetCliToolReference
`<DotnetCliToolReference>` item element specifies the CLI tool that the user wants to restore in the context of the project. It is 
a replacement for the `tools` node in `project.json`. 

```xml
<DotnetCliToolReference Include="<package-id>" Version="" />
```

*# Version
`Version` specifies the version of the package to restore. The attribute respect the rules of the NuGet versioning scheme.

* RuntimeIdentifiers
The `<RuntimeIdentifiers>` element lets you specify a semicolon-delimited list of [Runtime Identifiers (RIDs)](../../rid-catalog.md) for the project. 
RIDs enable publishing a self-contained deployments. 

```xml
<RuntimeIdentifiers>win10-x64;osx.10.11-x64;ubuntu.16.04-x64</RuntimeIdentifiers>
```


* RuntimeIdentifier
The `<RuntieIdentifier>` element allows you to specify only one [Runtime Identifier (RID)](../../rid-catalog.md) for the project. RIDs enable publishing a self-contained deployment. 

```xml
<RuntimeIdentifier>ubuntu.16.04-x64</RuntimeIdentifier>
```


* PackageTargetFallback 
The `<PackageTargetFallback>` element allows you to specify a set of compatible targets to be used when restoring packages. It is designed to allow packages that use the dotnet TxM to operate with packages that don't declare a dotnet TxM. If your project uses the dotnet TxM then all the packages you depend on must also have a dotnet TxM, unless you add the `<PackageTargetFallback>` to your project in order to allow non dotnet platforms to be compatible with dotnet. 

The following example provides the fallbacks for all targets in your project: 

```xml
<PackageTargetFallback>
    $(PackageTargetFallback);portable-net45+win8+wpa81+wp8
</PackageTargetFallback >
```

The following example specifies the fallbacks only for the `netcoreapp1.0` target:

```xml
<PackageTargetFallback Condition="'$(TargetFramework)'=='netcoreapp1.0'">
    $(PackageTargetFallback);portable-net45+win8+wpa81+wp8
</PackageTargetFallback >
```

## NuGet metadata properties
With the move to MSbuild, we have moved the input metadata that is used when packing a NuGet package from project.json to csproj files. The inputs are MSBuild properties so they have to go within a `<PropertyGroup>` group. The following is the list of properties that are used as inputs to the packing process when using the `dotnet pack` command or the `Pack` MSBuild target that is part of the SDK. 

### IsPackable
TBD

### PackageVersion
Specified a version that the resulting package will have. Accepts all forms of NuGet version string. 

### PackageId
Specify a name for the resulting package. If not specified, the `pack` operation will default to using the AssemblyName or directory name as the name of the package. 

### Title

A string of authors for this package.

Description of the package. This can be whatever the author of the package wants.
